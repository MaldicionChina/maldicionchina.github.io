It is a reality, software is becoming part of our lives more than expected. Thirty years ago, no one would have ever imagined how close people are connected with software and technology in general. Nowadays, this technological movement, from software development perspective, is forcing organizations to do their work better in order to give to their end users the correct features on time, and at a low cost. In summary be ‘more’ agile. In this situation, DevOps pushes all teams involved in the software development process to collaborate and deliver software faster and more often to customers and end users. This is where DevOps comes with a lot of agile practices to move a step closer to a process standardization allowing that. Some of those DevOps practices include:

* Automation of software building and releasing, to reduce time from code development to features delivering to production.
Version control from code to servers configurations to allow centralization, reproducibility , and consistency in software and infrastructure.
* Application and infrastructure monitoring to foster speed on feedback loop, troubleshooting solving, and in general to know the health of our software.
* DevOps strives to create a cultural movement where everyone involved in the product development should be working together, moving towards the same goals, and sharing responsibilities to help each other. Here, some questions arise.
How do we work in something in a way it can be delivered faster to production ? How do we know we are moving in the right direction ? How do we know we’re being ’agile’ enough ?

It is useful to bear Conway’s law in mind when thinking about how DevOps being implemented in your organization. It defines systems growth in the way that it imitates how your organization and teams are structured. Teams thinking how to implement big and fast continuous delivery process, will produce a successful CI/CD pipeline. However, teams thinking how to deliver features more often and get feedback faster, will succeed in delivering the right features on time.

DevOps is intended to include everyone who is involved in the product building process by making them participate early in a collaborative process. Helping a team to succeed with DevOps, starts with understanding the business goals and how they will help their customer and end user. That is why is good to take in mind Mike Dilworth words.

DevOps is a culture, not a role! The whole company needs to be doing DevOps for it to work.

Looking through teams and management.

It is well known that time to market, fixing a bug or just having a feature ready on time in production environments, are high priority goals in several organizations. That’s why IT teams are asked to not only deliver more products and services, they also want to move faster without compromising the reliability and stability of their system. DevOps seems like a way to solve those problems. But…

How do you share a clear vision for DevOps that will allow to accomplish all the stuff stated above in a way that will reduce uncertainty while getting people involved in the cultural change?

Here is where we need a statement beyond “We’re doing Devops”, because this won’t get people on board. Because, as opposed to traditional organizations, where developers are asked to deliver features as fast as possible, and operations are measured for the up time and performance. We end up in a context where teams see each other as adversaries while they should be working as allies. As a result, deploying software from development stage to production stage comprises the play of blame where no one wants to be responsible for the problems on production.

Here is where we need a clear purpose to understand why are we doing DevOps. Which is why we should follow some teachings from Start with Why by Simon Sinek.

> People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.

Is this a good point to answer why are we doing what we are doing ? Why are we doing DevOps now ?

This is the first question we should answer in order to move closer to the DevOps culture. Take small steps and check you are getting early successes. As The Lean Startup say. Begin with a cycle of planning, building, measuring, defining hypothesis and be sure you’re spending time in the work will help you to test those hypothesis. It is clear that DevOps is about continual learning and improvement rather than an end state. Start small, don’t involve all the organization in DevOps at the same time. Find small projects where people can be early adopters of the culture, and endure your pace when problems and tough times arise. Remember you are building an example case to show that following a clear purpose on DevOps will help both the organization and individual teams to make the customer happier.
